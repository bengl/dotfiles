For the moment I've only included my vim-related files, and my iTerm2 config. My shell profile changes too often to be useful.

A few notes:
1) These days I'm mostly doing Ruby on Rails stuff, but as you can see by some of my plugins, I like to dabble.
2) I use both Vim 7.3 (in iTerm2) and MacVim.
3) I don't disable the arrow keys. I still don't see the benefit. Sorry.
4) The iTerm2 config requires version 1.0.0.20111020 or greater.
5) FONTDIR could be a few places depending on your system. On a Mac, try ~/Library/Fonts/.  On Linux, try ~/.fonts/.
6) Ruby is required for some things to work, and so are gcc, make & friends.
7) Use these files in any way you see fit. They're public domain.

Installation:

$ curl -L -s http://bit.ly/benglviminstall | bash

And then install the font as described at the end of the install script.

For iTerm2, just import the plist file.
