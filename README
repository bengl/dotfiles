For the moment I've only included my vim-related files, and my iTerm2 config. More to come (probably).

A few notes:
1) These days I'm mostly doing Ruby on Rails stuff, but as you can see by some of my plugins, I like to dabble.
2) I use both Vim 7.3 (in iTerm2) and MacVim.
3) I don't disable the arrow keys. I still don't see the benefit. Sorry.
4) The iTerm2 config requires version 1.0.0.20111020.
5) FONTDIR could be a few places depending on your system. On a Mac, try ~/Library/Fonts/.  On Linux, try ~/.fonts/.
6) Ruby is required for some things to work, and so are gcc, make & friends.
7) Use these files in any way you see fit. They're public domain.

Usage:

# get everything from git
$ git clone git://github.com/bengl/dotfiles.git bengl_dotfiles
$ cd bengl_dotfiles
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
# link up the files
$ ln -s vim ~/.vim
$ ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
$ ln -s gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
# install the Menlo-Powerline font
$ wget https://gist.github.com/raw/1595572/417a3fa36e35ca91d6d23ac961071094c26e5fad/Menlo-Powerline.otf
$ mv Menlo-Powerline.otf FONTDIR
# bundle install vundle and everything else
$ vim # ignore the bunch of errors you'll get, and run the following vim commands
:BundleInstall
:q
$ # compile CommandT
$ cd vim/bundle/Command-T
$ rake make

And for iTerm2, just import the plist file.
