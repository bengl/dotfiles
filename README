For the moment I've only included my vim-related files. More to come (probably).

A few notes:
1) I tend to use iTerm2 with the Solarized-Dark theme.
2) These days I'm mostly doing Ruby on Rails stuff, but as you can see by some of my plugins, I like to dabble.
3) I use both Vim 7.3 (in iTerm2) and MacVim.
4) I don't disable the arrow keys. I still don't see the benefit. Sorry.
5) Use these files in any way you see fit. They're public domain.

Usage:

$ # get everything from git
$ git clone git://github.com/bengl/dotfiles.git bengl_dotfiles
$ cd bengl_dotfiles
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ # install pathogen
$ mkdir -p vim/autoload
$ curl https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/HEAD/autoload/pathogen.vim > vim/autoload/pathogen.vim
$ # link up the files
$ ln -s vim ~/.vim
$ ln -s vimrc ~/.vimrc
$ ln -s gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
