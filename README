For the moment I've only included my vim-related files, and my iTerm2 config. My shell profile changes too often to be useful.

A few notes:
1) I use both Vim 7.3 (in iTerm2) and MacVim.
2) I don't disable the arrow keys. I still don't see the benefit. Sorry.
3) The iTerm2 config requires version 1.0.0.20111020 or greater.
4) Ruby is required for some things to work, and so are gcc, make & friends.
5) Use these files in any way you see fit. They're public domain.

Installation:

$ curl -L -s http://bit.ly/benglvimrc > ~/.vimrc

And then install the font and use it in your terminal app:

For iTerm2, just import the plist file.

The first time you run vim after this, it will install all of its plugins.
