Bryan's Super-Awesome Vimrc
===========================

For the moment I've only included my super-awesome vimrc. My shell profile changes too often to be useful.

A few notes:

1. I use both Vim 7.3 (in iTerm2) and MacVim.
2. I don't disable the arrow keys. I still don't see the benefit. Sorry.
3. Ruby is required for some things to work.
4. Use these files in any way you see fit. They're public domain.

Features
--------

* A slew of plugins (check the Bundles section of the vimrc for details).
* Installs all these plugins on the first run automatically.

Installation
------------

    $ curl -L -s http://bit.ly/benglvimrc > ~/.vimrc

And then install this font and use it in your terminal app:

The first time you run vim after this, it will install all of its plugins.
